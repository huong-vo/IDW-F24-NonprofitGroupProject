## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to practive what we learned during the program and make a website for one of the given non-profit organizations. The created website should not look like the real one. The chosen website is [The Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee](https://www.elephants.com/). The remake aims to design the website from scratch and showcase some of the original website's key features. This gives a glimpse of the sanctuary and what they offers to the public.

This project is purely for personal learning and educational purposes and is not affiliated with the actual organization. 

## Features
The remake website includes the following features:
1. Home Page: An overview of some main services including donation, learning opportunities, live elecam, elenews subscription, and social icons.
2. About Page: A detailed page on the sanctuary's mission, impact, and values.
3. Donate and Contact Pages: Detailed pages for users to take actions and interactions with the website.
4. Responsive Design: A flexible layout that adapts to larger screens for the home page and various screen sizes for the donate and contact pages.   
5. Interactive Elements: The remake includes different elements such as hover effects on buttons, form validation, and an interactive map, enhancing user experience.
