for my website:
	do html and css simultaneously
		pros: can see page turning out piece by piece
		challenges: wasting too much time making it perfect while not seeing the big picture
		lesson: html first then css

for my project:
	do html first then css
	mistakes: doing css way too detailed for the specific screen in front of me, but there are more than one type of screens
		pros: have fine design on laptop
		challenges: hard to change when it comes to media queries
		lesson: 
			sometimes things look good on figma but not mean look good or accessible in reality
			worry about what how the elements should look in genereal and then design  (think about grid then) then media queries. while designing, small screens first then large screens.
