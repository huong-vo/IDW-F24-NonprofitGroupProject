                        <h2>Our Work</h2>
                        <p>Since 1995, The Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee has provided a home and care for 33 elephants, with 12 currently residing there and space for more. Originally covering 110 acres, the Sanctuary has expanded to over 3,060 acres, offering diverse, protected habitats. The Sanctuary is committed to providing lifelong care for elephants, adapting to their evolving needs as they age. This often involves collaboration with other elephant facilities and owners. <br>
                            Many elephants arrive at The Sanctuary through legal actions, particularly when authorities find violations of the Animal Welfare Act. For example, in 2003, Delhi, an Asian elephant who had been forced to travel and perform for over 50 years, was confiscated by the USDA and brought to the Sanctuary due to mistreatment. Since then, the Sanctuary has taken in 11 other elephants rescued by authorities.<br>
                            Raising public awareness about elephants' struggles is vital to the Sanctuaryâ€™s mission. Through free Distance Learning programs, it educates schools and communities worldwide about the challenges faced by Asian and African elephants. The Elephant Discovery Center in Hohenwald offers educational exhibits and programming to deepen understanding of elephants' role in our world.</p>

                        <h2>Our Values</h2>
                        <p>Elephants are intelligent beings with complex physical and social needs, and they deserve individualized care for life in a safe, natural habitat. 
                           The Sanctuary prioritizes humane, effective care using protected contact and positive reinforcement. Animal welfare standards cover nutrition, environment, health, behavior, and mental state.
                           Efforts to protect wild elephants are crucial for the species' survival, and collaboration with others enhances elephant care globally.<br></p>
